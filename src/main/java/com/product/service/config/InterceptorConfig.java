/**
 * Configuration class for defining and configuring custom interceptors in the Spring MVC application.
 * Custom interceptors can be used to perform pre-processing and post-processing of HTTP requests and responses.
 * <p/><b>Note: </b> Interceptors are not ideally suited as a security layer due to the potential for a mismatch with
 * annotated controller path matching, which can also match trailing slashes and path extensions transparently,
 * along with other path matching options. Many of these options have been deprecated, but the potential for a
 * mismatch remains.
 * <p/>
 * Generally, it is recommended to use Spring Security, which includes a dedicated MvcRequestMatcher to align
 * with Spring MVC path matching and also has a security firewall that blocks many unwanted characters in URL paths.
